            <p>I've been sailing the web development seas ever since my student years more than 2 years ago.I've been creating everything from regular websites and dashboards,all the way to mobile applications and open source libraries</p>
            <p>The main characteristic of my work one could give for all these years has been simple</p>
            <h4><span>Get ðŸ’© done.Fast.</span></h4>
            <p>I write clean and modern Js/Ts code with a rigid code-style, and I do it really fast.Coming from the times when all we had was jQuery and plain CSS,I prefer to use the technologies as our web lords have intended,resulting in simple,maintainable and accessible applications</p>
